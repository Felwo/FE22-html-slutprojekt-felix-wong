        <section class="about-info">
            <p>Born February 13, 1999, grew up in Malmö and have generally lived here all my life. Studied at Lund University for
                Bachelor civil engineering in road and traffic (1 year), but later switched to Malmö University where I expanded my knowledge
                in mechanical engineering, game development and interaction design for about 1 year each.
            </p>
            <p>I am technically interested in what I studied but later lean more towards the creative side of things. Because I took
                drawing/art more seriously, the last time I drew was in my mid-teens phase.</p>
